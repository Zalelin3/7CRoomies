# 7C Roomies

## What it is

The goal of 7C Roomies is to help students from the Claremont Colleges find people to share housing with. More specifically, the goal is to facilitate both searching based on compatibility and forming/committing to a group, in order to create a comprehensive and positive housing search experience for 7C's students.

## How it works

Initially, our users will create an account and a profile that includes basic information about themselves. Users who wish to start forming a group can create a post that specifies the type of housing they want and the kind of roomies they are looking for. Then, users, with or without a post, can search and filter posts by factors such as the type of housing, the number of spots left, etc. Users can also send an ``interest" to the post owner, which the post owner can approve or decline. Once an interest has been approved, the user can choose to accept the approval (similarly to accepting a job offer), which shows their commitment to joining the group. To reflect this, users can express multiple interests and receive multiple approvals, but is only allowed to accept a single post/group. Once a group is filled, no one else can join it. Users can withdraw their interest in or acceptance to join a post at any stage, which wipes any status they have with that post off the database.

Users who own posts have the authorization to edit certain fields in the post, approve interest requests and delete the post altogether. As a post-owner, they naturally commit to one spot in their own post. Therefore, no user can have more than one post as a time. Additionally, whilst they are allowed to express interests and receive approvals, they cannot join another group unless their post is deleted. We also allow a user to represent their friends who do not have an account in our system, called ``ghost users", to accommodate the common scenario where a group of friends who already commit to living together are searching for more people to fill the rest of the rooms. They are treated like a fixed group that performs every operation collectively.
